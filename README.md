# ChroMapper-Cinema
Cinema Viewer in ChroMapper

On Linux, only plays .webm with vp8 because Unity is bad :( Works in proton,tho.

## Done:

- [x] Play/Pause/Seek
- [x] Playback speed
- [x] Toggle button

## Maybe TODO?

- [ ] Add video / edit offset?

## I won't do it, but you can

- [ ] Cinema's environment changes
- [ ] Ffmpeg duct-tape for native linux playback
